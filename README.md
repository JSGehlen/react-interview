## This app is intended as a React pre-task for applying to Buutti as a developer.

### Refactoring 

- Components have been refactored from class components to functional components
- Components have been separated from App.js to their own components inside the Components folder
- Components have been styled to follow the Neumorphism/SoftUI trend with styled-components 💅
- The app has been deployed to Netlify and can be opened [here](https://react-interview-buutti.netlify.app/)

### ⭐️ Bonus ⭐️
- App has now a dark mode that can be turned on by pressing the 💡 lamp
- New todo's along with the mode (dark/light) that the user has given, are saved in localstorage for later use
